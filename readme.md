## Repository Outline
1. df1_loan.csv - data that used on the notebook
2. loan_Application_model.ipynb - The main notebook where all the process writen
3. rf_model.pkl - random forest model to be used


## Problem Background
`The dataset used here is Loan application dataset, we want to make machine learning model to make it easier if some new customer want to make loan application. The model will predict it first wether the customer is approved or not before it checked again by human agent.`

## Project Output
`The output of the project is machine learning model to be used to predict wether new loan application will be accepted or not`

## Data
Data url : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipin20/loan-application-data/data
`Data used here is customer data that have their loan application approved or not. The data is details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, etc`

## Method
`We will try to use KNN, SVM, AdaBoost with SVM, and Random Forest model and see which one performed the best`
